    "# Sockets in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows two levels of access to network services:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Low-level: to access the socket in the underlaying operating system. This allows you to implement clients and servers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High-level: to access specific application-level network protocols such as FTP, HTTP, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will understand the most famous concept in Networking $-$ **Socket Programming**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are sockets ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional (2 way) communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's has \"socket\" library that handles network communications and transports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Socket terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "**domain**: The family of network protocols used to transport data. The values are constants such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AF_INET (IP addresses from the Internet, safest option)\n",
    "- PF_INET (anything in the protocol, usually sockets/ports)\n",
    "- PF_UNIX (Unix sockets)\n",
    "- PF_X25  (protocols for wide-area network communications)\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**type**: The type of communication between two endpoints. \n",
    "- SOCK_STREAM for connection-oriented protocols such as TCP.\n",
    "- SOCK_DGRAM for connectionless protocols such as UDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- In connection-oriented protocols a connection is established between the endpoints to make sure the data transmitted from the source is delivered complete and correct to the destination. \n",
    " - Example: TCP\n",
    " \n",
    "- In connectionless protocols there is no connection and no guarantee that the data will be delivered correct and complete.\n",
    " - Example: UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**protocol**: Used to identify a protocol within a domain and a type. Typically zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**hostname**: a string or integer to identify the network interface. Can be a host name, for example 127.0.0.1, or an IPv6 address.\n",
    "\n",
    "**port**: Each server listens for clients using one or more ports. A port can be a number or a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on **AF_INET** (i.e. IPv4) sockets as they account for at least 99% of the sockets and we mainly consider **SOCK_STREAM** (TCP) sockets because you will learn from a STREAM socket more than anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The socket module\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a socket, you must use the socket.socket() function available in the **socket** module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "          s = socket.socket(socket_family, socket_type, protocol=0)\n",
    "          \n",
    "What are these parameters ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**socket_family** -- either AF_INET or AF_UNIX as explained earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**socket_type** -- either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**protocol** -- usually left out, defaulting to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the socket object, you can use any of the following methods to create your client or server programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server socket methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### s.bind()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method binds address (hostname, port number pair) to socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### s.listen()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method sets up and start TCP listener.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### s.accept()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method accepts the TCP client connection, waiting until connection arrives (blocking).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client socket methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### s.connect()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method actively initiates TCP server connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Socket Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "where s is a socket object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### s.recv(bufsize)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method receives TCP message. It receives data from the socket. The return value is a bytes object representing the data received. The maximum amount of data to be received at once is specified by bufsize.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### s.send()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method transmits TCP message. It sends data to the socket. The socket must be connected to a remote socket (server). send() returns the number of bytes sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### s.recvfrom(bufsize)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method receives UDP message. It receives data from the socket. The return value is a pair (bytes, address) where bytes is a bytes object representing the data received and address is the address of the socket sending the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### s.sendto()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method transmits UDP message. It sends data to the socket. The socket must be connected to a remote socket (server). send() returns the number of bytes sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### s.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "This method closes the socket. When the socket is closed, all future operations on the socket object will fail and the remote end will receive no more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### socket.gethostname()\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a string containing the hostname of the machine where the Python interpreter is currently executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### socket.gethostbyname(hostname)\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate a host name to IPv4 address format."
