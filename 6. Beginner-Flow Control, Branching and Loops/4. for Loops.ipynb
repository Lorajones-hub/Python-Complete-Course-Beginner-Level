The variable num will be assigned each number in the list in each iteration, in turn. The _if_ statement checks if the value of num mod 2 equals to 0, this expression is very common in many programming language to check if the number is an even number, like 2, 4, 6, ... etc. If the boolean expression **num % 2 == 0 is Ture**, the program will print Found an even number and that number. The _continue_ will then switch the control to the begining of the loop again where num will be set to next integer form the list generated by rang(). If the boolean expression **num % 2 == 0 is False**, the means that the number is odd, like 1, 3, 5, ... etc. and the program will print Found an odd number and that number."
