    "# SQLite3 Database\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about SQLite3, Python DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite3 databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite3 is a C language library that provides lightweight disk-based database and can be accessed using SQL query language. SQLite3 can be used for internal data storage application and also to prototype an application then port the code in larger databases such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL** (**Structured Query Language**) is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. It is mainly used to create tables in the database and to query (or ask) the database about the data stored to retrieve or modify that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to design a database of a bank. The main structures of any database are the tables that hold information.  You can use the SQL language to access the database and perform different operations on it. For instance, you can create a **table called clients** which stores information about differnt clients. This table will have columns such as **full_name**, **address**, **account_no**, **balance**, ... etc. You may also want to access and modify the table in different ways. Here are some examples of table operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrive records from the clients table, for example selecting clients who have a balance less than \\$1000. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Update some clients' records, for example to add $100 to his current balance or change his address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete some clients' records who have closed their accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add new clients records who recently joined the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries are operations done using SQL commands to access and manipulate the database and the most common queries are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - CREATE TABLE: to create a new table in the database.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - INSERT: to add new row (record) in the table.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - SELECT: to select a particular row(s) in the table.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - DELETE: to remove row(s) from the table.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - UPDATE: to update row(s) in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open connection to DB using SQLite3\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a database, import the sqlite3 module and use it to call connect() method that creates a **connection** object to your database. The database will be saved in a file with .db extension in your computer.\n",
