    "# What is a loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop (or repetition) means repeating a block of code a fixed number of times. Python provides two statements for creating loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_while ... else_ statement**\n",
    "- **_for ... in_ statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both _while_ and _for_ have more detailed syntax than the basic syntax we discussed in section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lecture, we will discuss the _while_ statement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for the _while ... else_ statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                                   while boolean_expression:\n",
    "                                       while block\n",
    "                                   else:\n",
    "                                       else block\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The else_ part is OPTIONAL and used only if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How this _while_ statement works?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the boolean_expression is _True_, the while block is executed. If the boolean_expression becomes _False_, the _while_ loop terminates, and if the optional _else_ is present, its block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, two statements can alter the flow of a normal loop, these are **_continue_** and **_break_** statements :\n",
    "\n",
    " 1) **_continue_ statement**: switches control (switches program execution) to the start of the loop.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2) **_break_ statement**: breaks out the loop and switches control to the statement following the loop. If the _else_ part exists, _break_ will switch control to the statement following the _else_ block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the while block, if a _**continue**_ statement is executed, control is immediately returned to the top of the loop, and the boolean_expression is evaluated again. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The _else_ part\n",
    "\n",
    "If the loop does not terminate normally, an optional _else_ block is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 cases where the _else_ suite is not executed:\n",
    "- If the loop is broken out of due to a _**break**_ statement, or\n",
    "- If the loop is broken out of due to a _**return**_ statement (if we write the loop inside a function or method), or \n",
    "- If an **exception** is raised\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The behavior of _else_ is the same in the _while_ loops, _for ... in_ loops, and _try ... except_ blocks.\n"
