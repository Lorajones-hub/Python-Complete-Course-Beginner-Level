    "\n",
    "**This lecture is NOT REQUIRED. It is an overview lecture prepared for you to have a basic idea of different topics in Python. If you have some time you can take a look at some sections here. Don't worry if you don't understand everything, we will cover ALL these topics in full detail during the course**. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### What do we mean by data types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any programming language must be able to do one important thing, **_representing items of data_** such as numbers, words, and group of data. For each of these data, there is something called a **data type** in the programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python language has several built-in data types. For example, Python represents _integers_ (which are positive and negative whole numbers including zero) using the _int_ type. Python represents strings (sequences of characters) such as names, addresses, etc. using the _str_ type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "12, 4, -10, 0, -973\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "'Simon' <br>\n",
    "\"Hello World!\" <br>\n",
    "'345\\*&^%\\_=+key' <br>\n",
    "\"\"   **This is an empty string**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using any interactive interpreter such as Python Shell, IDEL, or Jupyter Notebook, you can type integer or strings values and you'll see that the interpreter will return that value."

    "## Piece 2: Object References\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have data types, sometimes we need _**variables**_ to store the values of these data types. It is important to understand that **Python doesn't have variables, instead it has _objects references_**. ALL object-oriented programming languages use objects and object references.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind that everything in Python is an object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an object reference?\n",
    "\n",
    "_An object reference is a name (also called an identifier) that refers to the object in memory_, this means that the object reference holds the memory address of that object stored in the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, variables and object references mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax used in Python is VERY SIMPLE:\n",
    "\n",
    "                                        object reference = value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a syntax in programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **syntax** in programming is the set of rules the programmer has to follow to write correct code or statements in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: <br>\n",

    "                                    x = 'blue' \n",

    "                                    t = 6 \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python there is no need for _pre-declaration_, this means that we don't need to type str x before x = 'blue' \n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the first beautiful feature in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The whole idea is this**: when Python sees the statement x = 'blue', it will create a _str_ object with text 'blue' then creates an object reference called x and makes it refer to that _str_ object. Same thing will happen with the second statements y = 'red'. With s = 2 and t = 6, Python again creates _int_ objects with value 2 and 6 and creates two object references _s_ and _t_ who will refer to objects 2 and 6 respectively.\n",
